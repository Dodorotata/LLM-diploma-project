    "CONCLUSIONS/COMMENTS:\n",
    "* Llama-index guidance pydantic program dicarded due to LLM not outputting correct json schema even with mixtral. # -> OutputParserException: Failed to parse pydantic object from guidance program. Probably the LLM failed to produce data with right json schema. Most probably caused by truncation of output. max_len och max_tokens should be set higher, this was however not investigated in the current notebook.\n",
    "* Extract data to json works well for select from a list of choices and generation funcion with llama-cpp-python==0.2.26 for guidance 0.1.13. However for Guidance 0.1.14 llama-cpp-python 0.2.62 can be used with good results.\n",
    "* Content of the generated output from longer text or scientific article good quality. Not all instructions in prompt are followed. Output can possibly be improved with prompting: propmpt engineering, chain-of-thought, few-shot examples.\n",
    "* Fairly good results extracting information from scientific articles and patents. Interestingly order of Field() in pydantic model matters for output. For example summary early might be creating chain-of-thought effect considering that large part of the context window is probably used. \n",
    "* For satisfactory results each field has to be described/prompted which is easily done with Pydantic and Guidance. It is also convinient that each Field generated by Guidance can be accesses as a key:value from generated output\n",
    "* Mistral and Mixtral performed similarly on patents. Using choice prompting or yes/no prompting resulted in approximately same number of mistakes where the best was Mixtral with yes/no prompting with 85% accuracy on choice questions. Good output from both models on free text generation Fields such as 'summary'.\n",
    "* Mistral ~1 min/patent while Mixtral ~3min/patent.\n",
    "* Further work should include for example:\n",
    "    * prompting with choice for LLM to answer it does not have enough information\n",
    "    * try to only send in summary and claims from patents rather than whole documents to see if performance will improve\n",

    "#  'claim_analysis': 'The patent describes a twist drill and bone tap for assessing jaw bone quality during dental implantation procedures. The twist drill includes a shank with a proximal section and a distal section, a mounting portion in the proximal section adapted to connect with a torque monitoring device, and a drill bit connected to the distal section with a cutting portion having at least one helical flute formed thereon. The drill bit has a cutting portion with a helix angle of between about 45 to about 55 degrees, and a drill point located at the end of the cutting portion. The bone tap includes a shank with opposed ends, a mounting portion in one end adapted to connect with a torque monitoring device, and a cutting portion in the other end with at least one helical thread formed thereon. The medial portion between the cutting portion and the mounting portion has a diameter less than the diameter of the cutting portion to minimize friction forces. The method for assessing bone quality involves providing a drill with a shank, a mounting portion, and a drill bit, drilling into the bone, and quantifying the density of the bone based on the measured torque to determine the quality of the bone for implantation. The drill bit has a helix angle of between about 45 to about 55 degrees, and the drill point has a helix angle of about 50 degrees and a point angle of about 130 degrees. The tap has a tapping length of approximately 10 mm and a cutting portion comprised of approximately the first four threads. The method involves inserting a few threads of the cutting portion into a predrilled pilot bore of the bone, incrementally tapping the cutting portion into the hole, and quantifying the density of the bone based on the measured torque to determine the quality of the bone for implantation. The tap has a non-cutting, steering portion located at the end of the shank. The method further involves comparing the measured torque to predetermined torque values of classified bone qualities. The patent also describes a method for assessing bone quality during tapping using a tap with a shank, a mounting portion, a cutting portion, and a medial, non-cutting portion, and a method for assessing bone quality from cutting forces while drilling into bone prior to and during an implantation procedure using a drill with a shank, a mounting portion, and a drill bit.',\n",

The reservoir is arranged to exert a mechanical pressure on the irrigation liquid therein, thereby maintaining the irrigation liquid under pressure, and the control unit comprises a control valve for releasing irrigation liquid from the reservoir for discharge through the probe. The reservoir may be made of a rigid or semi-rigid material, and have at least one moveable wall and a retention element to exert a force to retain the moveable wall in a contracted position. Alternatively, the reservoir may comprise an elastically stretchable container, which when elastically stretched exerts a mechanical pressure on the irrigation liquid therein. The probe may comprise an inflatable balloon for fixing the catheter in a body cavity, and the control unit may be arranged to control the fluid for the balloon. The control unit may further comprise a second control valve for releasing irrigation liquid from the reservoir for inflation of the inflatable balloon, and a third control valve for releasing fluid from the balloon when inflated. The irrigation system may further comprise a pump arranged for pumping a fluid to the balloon for inflation, and a volume indicator arranged within the reservoir. The irrigation system is suitable for rectal irrigation and self-administration. The patent also mentions that the reservoir may be loaded by the hydraulic pressure in common water distribution systems, or by mechanical compression means, or by a gas cartridge. The valves and the controls for the valves may be realized in many different ways, and the pumping of the irrigation liquid may be direct or indirect. The mechanical pressurization of the reservoir may be achieved by many different types of springs, elastic means, and the like. The valves may also allow setting of intermediate opening states, in a stepped or continuous fashion. The patent also mentions that the irrigation liquid can be any liquid which is capable of irrigation the body cavity of interest, including water, hypertonic aqueous salt solutions, solutions or suspensions of cathartic agents, and mineral oil. The patent also mentions that the irrigation system can be used for carrying out anal irrigation by filling the reservoir with a liquid, connecting the reservoir and the probe to the control unit, inserting the probe into the rectum, inflating the balloon for fixing the probe in the body, transferring irrigation liquid from the reservoir to the probe for irrigation, and deflating and removing the probe after irrigation is completed.',\n",
