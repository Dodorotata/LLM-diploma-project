    "CONCLUSIONS:\n",
    "* Overall, the extraction process was effective with summaries and keywords generated correctly, with 10 keywords as anticipated, but there were a few issues:\n",
    "*\tthe abstract was included with the document title\n",
    "*\tsome nodes produced more than 2 expected questions without answers instead of the expected 2 questions with answers\n",
    "* Runtime extracting from 7 nodes (2 pages) was ~3 min.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Custom Metadata Extractor modules can be crated. This has not been investigated in current notebook.\n",
    "* Pydantic Extractor seems to work well with OpenAIPydanticProgram, however swiching to the local GuidancePydanticProgram breaks the pipline (https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/issues/9914)\n",
    "* GuidancePydanticProgram without the pipeline dones not output structured enough data:  OutputParserException: Failed to parse pydantic object from guidance program. Probably the LLM failed to produce data with right json schema. Most probably caused by truncation of output. max_len och max_tokens should be set higher, this was however not investigated in the current notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "* NOTE: version for llama-cpp-python was upgraded to latest when installing llama-index-llms-llama-cpp. Latest version might give unstable output for {Guidance}. Stable output with llama-cpp-python==0.2.26\n",

    "#                         Abstract:\\nThis study aimed to provide an overview of the current state of research on breast cancer and protein synthesis using bibliometric analysis. We conducted a comprehensive search in Scopus database for articles published between 2015 and 2022 with the keywords “breast cancer,” “protein synthesis,” and related terms, including “translation,” “expression,” “cancer proteins,” and “proteomics.” The results were analyzed based on various metrics, including publication trends, journal impact factors, most productive countries, authors, and keywords. Our analysis revealed that there has been a significant increase in research publications on breast cancer and protein synthesis over the past few years. The most productive journals in this field were Journal of Biological Chemistry, Cancer Research, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, and Oncogene. Keyword analysis showed that “breast cancer,” “expression,” “cancer,” “protein,” and “translation” were the most commonly researched topics. Our bibliometric analysis underscores the importance of continued research in this area to gain a better understanding of the biology of breast cancer and develop new therapies.\\nIntroduction:\\nBreast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women worldwide, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases diagnosed in 2020 [1]. The incidence rate of breast cancer has been increasing over the past few decades, and it is projected to continue rising due to aging populations and changing lifestyles [2]. Despite advances in early detection and treatment, breast cancer remains a complex disease with significant morbidity and mortality.\\nOne of the key factors in the development and progression of breast cancer is protein synthesis. Proteins play essential roles in various cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and metabolism [3]. Dysregulation of protein synthesis can lead to the development of various diseases, including cancer [4]. In breast cancer, abnormalities in protein expression have been implicated in tumorigenesis, progression, and drug resistance [5–7].\\nGiven the importance of protein synthesis in breast cancer, it is essential to understand the current state of research in this area. Bibliometric analysis is a powerful tool for evaluating scientific literature and identifying trends and patterns [8]. In this study, we aimed to provide an overview of the current state of research on breast cancer and protein synthesis using bibliometric analysis.\\nMethods:\\nWe conducted a comprehensive search in Scopus database for articles published between 2015 and 2022 with the keywords “breast cancer,” “protein synthesis,” and related terms, including “translation,” “expression,” “cancer proteins,” and “proteomics.” We excluded reviews, editorials, conference proceedings, and letters to the editor. The search results were analyzed based on various metrics, including publication trends, journal impact factors, most productive countries, authors, and keywords.\\nResults:\\nA total of 1,538 articles were identified in the search, with an average of 128 articles per year (Figure 1). The number of publications has been increasing steadily over the past few years, indicating a growing interest in this research area.\\nThe most productive journals in this field were Journal of Biological Chemistry, Cancer Research, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, and Oncogene (Table 1). These journals have high impact factors and are widely recognized as leaders in the field of cancer research.\\nThe most productive countries in terms of research output were the United States, China, and the United Kingdom (Figure 2). The United States accounted for the largest share of publications, followed by China and the United Kingdom.\\nThe most productive authors in this field were Xiaohong Wang, Wei Zhang, and Jianhua Wu (Table 2). These authors have published numerous articles on breast cancer and protein synthesis and have made significant contributions to the field.\\nKeyword analysis revealed that “breast cancer,” “expression,” “cancer,” “protein,” and “translation” were the most commonly researched topics (Figure 3). These keywords reflect the primary focus of research in this area, which is on understanding the role of protein expression in breast cancer development and progression.\\nDiscussion:\\nOur bibliometric analysis provides valuable insights into the current state of research on breast cancer and protein synthesis. The increasing number of publications in this field indicates a growing interest in this research area and highlights the importance of continued research to gain a better understanding of the biology of breast cancer and develop new therapies.\\nThe most productive journals',\n",

    "#                     Abstract: \\nBreast cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease that requires continued research efforts to improve diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment options. Protein synthesis plays a crucial role in breast cancer growth, survival, and metastasis. In this study, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of the literature on protein synthesis and breast cancer to provide an overview of the current state of research in this field. We identified key researchers, institutions, countries, and keywords, as well as trends and patterns in the literature. Our findings suggest that research on protein synthesis and breast cancer is a rapidly growing field, with a focus on hormones, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and targeted therapeutic interventions. The most frequent keywords used in the literature include \"protein synthesis,\" \"breast cancer,\" \"ribosome,\" \"translation,\" and \"mRNA.\" The collaboration networks among authors reveal several key collaborations between researchers from different countries, particularly those between the United States and China. Our bibliometric analysis provides valuable insights into the evolution of research on protein synthesis and its relevance to breast cancer, offering a foundation for future research directions in this area.\\nKeywords: breast cancer, protein synthesis, hormones, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), bibliometric analysis.',\n",
