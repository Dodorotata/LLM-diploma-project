    "#  'summary': 'Breast cancer is a complex disease that can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetic mutations, hormonal imbalances, and lifestyle choices. One of the key factors in the development and progression of breast cancer is the overexpression of certain proteins. In this article, we undertake a bibliometric analysis of the literature on breast cancer and protein synthesis, aiming to provide crucial insights into this esoteric realm of investigation. Our approach was to scour the Web of Science database, between 2003 and 2022, for articles containing the keywords “breast cancer” and “protein synthesis” in their title, abstract, or keywords. We deployed bibliometric analysis software, exploring a range of measures such as publication output, citation counts, co-citation analysis, and keyword analysis. Our search yielded 2998 articles that met our inclusion criteria. The number of publications in this area has steadily increased, with a significant rise observed after 2003. Most of the articles were published in oncology or biology-related journals, with the most publications in Journal of Biological Chemistry, Cancer Research, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, and Oncogene. Keyword analysis revealed that “breast cancer,” “expression,” “cancer,” “protein,” and “translation” were the most commonly researched topics. In conclusion, our bibliometric analysis of breast cancer and related protein synthesis literature underscores the burgeoning interest in this research. The focus of the research is primarily on the relationship between protein expression in breast cancer and the development and treatment of tumors. These studies have been instrumental in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Sustained research in this area will yield essential insights into the biology of breast cancer and the genesis of cutting-edge therapies.',\n",
